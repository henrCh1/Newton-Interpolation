# Newton-Interpolation
该程序使用Python编写，用于使用牛顿插值法计算函数的插值。根据插值多项式的唯一性原理，牛顿插值多项式在形式上与拉格朗日多项式有所不同。牛顿插值法的优点在于，当增加新的插值节点时，只需在原多项式中添加一项，从而大大简化了程序的复杂度。代码中包含详细的注释，以便您更好地理解其内容。

The program is written in Python and is used to calculate the interpolation of a function using Newton's interpolation method. Based on the uniqueness of interpolation polynomials, the Newton interpolation polynomial differs from the Lagrange polynomial only in its form. The advantage of Newton's interpolation method is that when new nodes are added, it only requires adding a new term to the original polynomial, greatly simplifying the complexity of the program.
